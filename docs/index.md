Boo is an object oriented statically typed programming language for the .NET and Mono
runtimes with a python inspired syntax and a special focus on language and compiler
extensibility.

A good way to start is by reading the [Boo Manifesto](BooManifesto.pdf) and following
the [Primer](Primer/Starting-Out) to learn the language step by step.

!!! note
    The Boo Primer is also available in [Traditional Chinese](http://zh.wikibooks.org/wiki/%E7%A8%8B%E5%BA%8F%E8%A8%AD%E8%A8%88:BOO) (繁體中文), translated by Yan-ren Tsai aka Elleryq.

    The english version is downloadable in [PDF format](BooPrimer.pdf).

For a more detailed explanation about the features in the language check out the [Language Guide](Guide/Structure-of-a-Boo-Script).
