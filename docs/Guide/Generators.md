From time to time there is the need to represent closed sets such as customers in Brazil or open sets like the numbers in the Fibonacci series in a succinct and **memory conservative** way. Enter generators.

Generators are language constructs capable of producing more than one value when used in an iteration context such as the for in loop.

The following generators are supported:

* [Generator Expressions](Generator-Expressions)
* [Generator Methods](Generator-Methods)
* [List Generators](List-Generators)
